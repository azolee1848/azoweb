            <p>
              In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page,
              created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign.
              Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage
              exploration, landing pages are designed a single goal, known as a
              call to action. It's this focus that makes landing pages the best
              option for increasing the conversion rates of your marketing
              campaigns and lowering your cost of acquiring a lead or sale. -

            <p>
              Personal web pages are created by an individual to contain content
              of a personal nature rather than content pertaining to a company.
              Personal web pages are primarily used for informative or
              entertainment purposes but can also be used for personal career
              marketing by containing a list of the individual's skills,
              experience and a CV. - wikipedia.org

            <p>
              A corporate site presents a company to all its audiences and not
              only to its customers or users. The corporate site is classically
              distinguished from the commercial site intended only for customers
              or users. On the content side, the corporate site endeavors to
              promote the company, its history, values, commitments, purpose,
              etc. and not directly its products or solutions. - wearecom.fr

              Every business has its own workflow, and external tools and
              services aren't always the best fit for what you need to get done.
              They aren't perfect for your unique business, and it may be hard
              (or impossible) to implement them on your website. Luckily, we
              have a solution to your problem. We'll analyze your needs and
              build a powerful, useful web application that makes your life
              easier. - activemedia.com
